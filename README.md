# SimpleMarkdownEditor
***A very simple markdown editor.***

This software is created because the I hate it that almost all the markdown editors
are using Chrorium as their core and make their size so big such as 100M+.  
I think a simple markdown editor should not need to be so large as that, many functions in the
Chrorium are not used in a markdown editor.Markdown is a light-weight language, its editor should
not be so "heavy".  
This program is created all in C# using the C# library
[CommonMark.NET](https://github.com/Knagis/CommonMark.NET).
it uses CommonMark.NET to change markdown to html and then uses WPF WebBrowser to show it.
And it is less than 1M. Though it doesn't have many functions, but I think it is also useful.
After all, we always need a notepad to edit something
rather than using Visual Studio every times.
